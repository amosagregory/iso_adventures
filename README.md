# 👋 Hi, I'm amosagregory

> Elevating code, crafting tooling, and shipping delightful developer experiences — one commit at a time.

I'm a pragmatic, curious software engineer who loves building tools, automations, and clean developer-facing experiences. I focus on reliable systems, readable code, and bringing practical ideas into production quickly.

---

## 🚀 What I do
- Build CLI tools, developer utilities, and small services that solve real problems.
- Design clear, testable code with an emphasis on observability and ergonomics.
- Contribute to open source and mentor others through actionable PRs and thoughtful reviews.

---

## 🛠️ Core Skills
- Languages: Python, and other languages you use
- Tooling: CLI design, testing, packaging, automation
- Observability: logging, metrics, dashboards
- Systems: cross-platform scripting, process and resource monitoring
- Collaboration: Git, code review, documentation


---

## ⭐ Featured Projects
Here are a few highlights:

- [eva_cli](https://github.com/amosagregory/iso_adventures) — A terminal dashboard inspired by Evangelion UI themes for system monitoring (CLI + rich UI).

---

## 📈 GitHub & OSS
I actively contribute to open source. My approach:
- Small, focused PRs that are easy to review
- Clear changelogs and tests where appropriate
- Prioritize automation so maintainers are empowered

If you maintain a project and want help with issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`, let’s collaborate.

---

## 🧭 How I Work
- Prefer incremental improvements and frequent releases.
- Document features and rationale in code and README.
- Use automation for repetitive tasks (CI, formatters, release scripts).

---

## 🧩 Currently Learning
- frameworks, languages, concepts.
- Rust for systems tooling, observability practices, and advanced Python concurrency.

Thanks for stopping by — I keep this README lightweight so visitors can quickly find what matters. Want a one-page portfolio instead? I can create a polished version with screenshots, badges, and a downloadable CV.
